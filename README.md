## Introduction
Hi, in this project I built a book keeping web app.

## Description
The user type in a book info (title, author, pages and read status) and click the "Submit" button
Those info will be stored as a Book Object in an myLibrary[], and displayed on the UI.
The user can change the read status of the book or delete a book anytime using relev.ant buttons.
Changes are updated with that book object in myLibrary[].
